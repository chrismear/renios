It builds versions of Ren'Py and its dependencies that will run on iOS, and provides scripts to help you assemble these with your game into an Xcode project that will build for iOS.\r\n\r\nYou can download a pre-built binary distribution from here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/chrismear/renios/wiki/Downloads\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** This is still very early, proof-of-concept code. There are known bugs and missing UI. It is not ready to use for a public release of a game.\r\n\r\nPackaging Requirements\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nTo package your Ren'Py game and build it for iOS, you will need the binary distribution of Ren'iOS, and Xcode 4.5 or higher.\r\n\r\nPackaging Instructions\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nIn the renios directory, run:\r\n\r\n    ./tools/create-xcode-project MyGame /path/to/your/game/directory\r\n\r\nwhere `MyGame` is the name of the app you want to create, and the path points to the `game` directory of your Ren'Py game.\r\n\r\nThis will produce an Xcode project in `app-mygame`. This should be ready to build and run on a device.\r\n\r\nBuild Requirements\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nIf you want to use Ren'iOS to build Ren'Py and its dependencies from source, you will need the following software:\r\n\r\n* Xcode\r\n* Mercurial\r\n* Cython\r\n\r\nBuild the software by changing into the `dependencies` directory, and running `./scripts/build.sh`. This will download and build Ren'Py and its dependencies.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nSome portions of Ren'iOS are based on works licensed under the LGPL (various versions). Therefore these portions are also licensed under the LGPL.\r\n\r\nBecause of these portions which must be licensed under an LGPL, the single license that applies to Ren'iOS taken as a whole is the [LGPL Version 3](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html).\r\n\r\nIn addition to that license, those portions of Ren'iOS that are not required to be licensed under the LGPL are also individually licensed under the [MIT (Expat) license](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat).\r\n\r\nEach file/directory in Ren'iOS contains a permissions notice that indicates which license(s) apply to that file/directory.\r\n\r\nAn application binary that you build using Ren'iOS should not itself need to be licensed under the LGPL.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012, 2013 Chris Mear <chris@feedmechocolate.com>\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
