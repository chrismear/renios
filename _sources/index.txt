Ren'iOS |version| Documentation
===============================

Ren'iOS helps you package a `Ren'Py <http://www.renpy.org>`_ game into an app that will run on iOS. It comes with versions of Ren'Py and its dependencies that will run on iOS, and provides scripts to help you assemble these with your game into an Xcode project that will build for iOS.

You can download Ren'iOS from here:

https://github.com/chrismear/renios/releases

If you encounter problems, bugs or have feature suggestions, please add them to the issue tracker here:

https://github.com/chrismear/renios/issues

**NOTE:** This is still very early, proof-of-concept code. There are known bugs and missing UI. It is not ready to use for a public release of a game.
