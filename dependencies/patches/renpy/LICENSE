For the purpose of LGPL compliance, the source code to all LGPL
software we depend on is either in the Ren'Py package (available from
http://www.renpy.org/), or in the renpy-deps package
(http://www.renpy.org/dl/lgpl/). We believe compliance can be achieved
by including a copy of this license with every copy of Ren'Py you
distribute, and referring to it in your project's README file.

Ren'Py may be distributed alongside the jEdit or Editra text
editors. Editra is licensed under the wxWindows license, while
jEdit is under the GNU General Public License.
