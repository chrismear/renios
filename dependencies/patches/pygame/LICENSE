These files incorporate work from pygame covered by the following copyright and permission notice:

  This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2.1, which can
  be found in the file "doc/LGPL". I reserve the right to place
  future versions of this library under a different license.

  This basically means you can use pygame in any project you want,
  but if you make any changes or additions to pygame itself, those
  must be released with a compatible license. (preferably submitted
  back to the pygame project). Closed source and commercial games are
  fine.

  The programs in the "examples" subdirectory are in the public
  domain.
